				<h2>Journal Entry #2: Ordering Materials and Determining how to Construct Product</h2>
				<h5>How am I going to create my product and what do I need? August 7, 2018</h5>

				<p>Once I finished my success criteria and process plan, I decided to determine right away how I would construct my product. I looked at many different sources that all had different methods of constructing a solar powered portable phone charger. I looked through the instructions in each of my resources very carefully, making sure to get a brief understanding of all the components involved within this project. I also made sure to sketch out diagrams, and circuit diagrams (if there were any), of the various solar powered phone charger, to get a better understanding of how each charger is constructed and how it is supposed to work. After doing so, I finally determined what version of the solar charger would be best for me to work on. Through careful consideration, I picked this solar charger (video linked above) that is built on a breadboard. There are not many materials used in this version, and soldering is not mandatory through this process, which makes this process a lot more safe and efficient. Soldering may be required if the positive and negative jumper wires cannot be screwed onto the solar panel, but this does not matter. The process is just easier and safer without soldering. I also found that because this process does not really utilize lots of materials or many tools either, it would provide more leeway to improvement, as the design can easily be deconstructed and reconstructed again. So, if I want to make any improvements, they can be easily implemented.  Also, I was able to get a strong understanding of how and why this product is constructed the way it is, and a strong understanding is very crucial in implementing my own ideas and innovations into this product. This understanding helped me construct another diagram that included any improvements or new features I may add from my own creativity to further enhance my product. Now once I’ve determined what kind of solar powered portable phone charger I am going to construct, I listed all the materials and finally ordered them! Some materials are expected to arrive quite soon, including jumper wires, the breadboard, and the solar panel, so I can start experimenting with my project early on. However, other materials are expected to arrive much later, but that should not hamper my progress much, because it does not take long to construct a solar powered phone charger (around an hour for someone like me, who does not have much experience). These are the materials I have ordered:</p>
<p class="indented">3 Solar Panels at 5V (volts) and 300mA (milliamperes)</p>
<p class="indented">1 Breadboard</p>
<p class="indented">140 Jumper wires (Not all of them will be used)</p>
<p class="indented">100uf (microfarad) capacitor</p>
<p class="indented">2200uf (microfarad) capacitor</p>
<p class="indented">L7805 Voltage Regulator</p>
<p>Apart from the ordered materials listed above, this project also requires a phone (for obvious reasons) and a male to female USB charging cable, which we already have, so we did not order it. The cable also needs to be spliced (aka cut) using pliers. We already have pliers (and scissors, if needed), so those were not ordered either. 
I am also considering experimenting with the breadboard, and testing it out, along with the solar panel, by making a simple LED breadboard circuit. This is a cool little experiment I could try out and it would be a great way to test out my solar panel. 
Also, currently I am using my old phone’s USB charging cable for my charger, which I may replace with a universal 3 in 1, 4 in 1, or 5 in 1 charging cable when I try improving my product. For those who do not know what a universal charging cable is, it is basically a regular charging cable but instead of only being able to charge one phone at a time, it can charge multiple phones at once. For example, a 3 in 1 universal charging cable can charge three phones at once.
Another way I am currently thinking of improving my product is to place 3 solar panels parallel to each other on the breadboard, so that the power from all 3 solar panels can be harnessed to charge the phone. Although this may seem like I may over charge the phone, as 3 solar panels at 5 volts technically adds up to 15 volts, and 15 volts is much too high for a phone, which usually is supposed to receive 5 volts. However, remember that I mentioned the solar panels are going to be set parallel to each other, which means the voltage throughout the circuit is the same (parallel circuits have same voltage throughout), which means the voltage will stay at 5V. 
As of now, I have laid a strong foundation for how I am going to build my solar powered portable phone charger, what I need to build it, and have already started thinking about ways to improve my original idea for the product. I have done some brief research and have drawn many diagrams to understand how the various solar powered phone chargers I looked at work. I have ordered the materials necessary for this project and am hoping that they will be able to ship earlier then expected.</p>
