				<h2>Journal Entry #3: Making these Blogs!</h2>
				<h5>How I Make Blogs for my Process Journal Entries, August 11, 2018</h5>

				<p>Today, I wanted to make a blog about my blogs. I really dedicate a lot of time and effort into making these blogs, and I thought I should show a demonstration of how I create them. This blog is currently my third blog I have worked on, and my third process journal entry. The reason I chose this format to document my personal project progress is because I wanted to be creative in documenting my progress and I wanted to explore and learn something new. Also, I recently started playing around with html, so I thought it would be a cool idea to use html to create my process journal entries. It provided me a great opportunity to learn something new and interesting, and something that could be very applicable in the future. The layout for my blogs were off of a blog layout tutorial by W3schools and I used their guide to help set this layout. Then I edited the program for the layout so that it fitted my needs. For example, I changed the text, or I added functions for aligning my text, indenting paragraphs. I added functions to add images or links, and I even took out some components that I thought were unnecessary. The video linked above will show a demonstration of me coding out a process journal blog, and the various tasks I had to perform to create my blog. The original video is over an hour long, so I time lapsed the video. But the main purpose of the video is to demonstrate me working on the blog, not giving a tutorial of how to create one. I have really enjoyed creating these blogs, and they have taught me a lot about html and computer software in general. </p>
