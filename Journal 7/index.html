				<h5>Buying a Soldering Iron, September 10, 2018</h5>

				<figcaption>Weller Medium Duty Soldering Iron</figcaption>
				<p>Hello! Today I went with my dad and purchased a soldering iron. A soldering iron melts and puts a filler metal (solder) into the joints of the two or more items (which are usually metals) being joined together. This is an effective way of combining various components of an electric device while still keeping the electrical device conductive. I needed a soldering iron so that I could attach jumper wires to my solar panel, which would then help me connect my solar panel to my breadboard. I have gathered all the pieces of equipment necessary for my project. However, I still plan on doing more research, and investigating and learning more about electrical components and solar energy before I begin constructing my product. Today's process journal will be quite short, because nothing much has been accomplished today. However, I felt it was important to notify the arrival of the soldering iron, because it is a key piece of equipment that will be very useful for my project. I plan to continue working on my project, and hopefully get the research done by the end of this week.</p>
