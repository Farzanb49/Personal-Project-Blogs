				<h2>Journal Entry #12: Impacts of Solar Energy: Research</h2>
				<h5> Solar Energy's Impact on the Environment, October 20, 2018</h5>
				<img src="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/news_article_image_top_slideshow/public/images/2016/MIT-PPA-1_0.jpg?itok=tIJwQDmn" alt="capacitor2200" style="height:200px;">
				<p>The purpose of my product is to create environmentally friendly technology that would help me explore the field of technology in an environmentally conscious way. I did some research on the effects of solar power in our environment to further my understanding of the role renewable resources play in environmentally friendly technology. Additionally, I have calculated the carbon offset of my solar powered charger. I have compiled some fundamental facts that have help me develop a fundamental understanding of the significance of solar power. The presence of climate change has been addressed as the greatest environmental concern and many global organizations and governments are frantically taking action. Climate change has many devastating consequences, and many predict that it could deplete our Earth in just a matter of decades. From NASA’s website, the consequences of climate change include:</p>
<p>-	2.5 to 10-degree Fahrenheit increase in the next century</p>
<p>-	Arctic likely to become ice free</p>
<p>-	Changing precipitation patterns</p>
<p>-	Increasing frequency of intense (category 4-5) hurricanes</p>
<p>-	Sea levels will rise 1-4 feet by 2100</p>
<p>-	Increased heat waves and droughts</p>
<p>-	More and lengthier frost-free seasons</p>
<p>You can clearly see the negative consequences of climate change. Thus, renewable energy sources are relied on to provide cleaner sources of energy. They offset carbon emissions that otherwise would contribute to depleting our ozone layer and add to global warming. Solar energy is a modern day renewable energy source that is eco-friendly. However, it requires sunlight, and it is typically expensive. However, prices for solar panels are consistently decreasing, and now solar panels cost about just as much as typical fossil fuels. I looked over some further research and data that I will provide in my report. However, I wanted to conclude with my analysis that I made about the carbon offset from my technology. Using Solar Mango’s online calculator, I calculated that a solar powered technology providing 2W of solar power in a region providing 3kWh of solar power would offset carbon emissions by 0.00219 tons. Although this amount seems miniscule, it is equivalent to 4.38 pounds of carbon reduced. This is all from one tiny DIY solar powered phone charger that took less than an hour to develop (excluding the enhancements made, such as adding extra solar panel cardboard base, etc. Also, we faced numerous issues through the development process which made the initial construction time nearly 2 hours). The product also was quite cheap to construct, costing around 10 to 20 dollars. As technology progresses, renewable energy is bound to become more efficient. Creating eco-friendly technology is not as challenging as it seems. It shows how little effort truly is required to make a positive impact on our world. If businesses could enhance and develop products through more eco-friendly processes, such as using solar panel, carbon reduction would be immense.
