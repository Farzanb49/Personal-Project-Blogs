				<h2>Journal Entry #16: Finishing Product: Enhancing Aesthetics + Further Evaluation</h2>
				<h5> Adding a Cardboard Structure for Support, November 16, 2018</h5>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/Kf4QbkQ.png" alt="capacitor2200" style="height:200px;">
				<p>I concluded the design of my product today with the addition of a cardboard base structure that would hold up the solar powered phone charger. Rather than leaving the charger in the flimsy state that it was in, I felt it would be wiser to add a carboard support that would hold up the solar panels and the breadboard simultaneously. I also felt it was necessary to make some aesthetical changes to enhance my product, and the cardboard base provided as a great improvement. I did not fulfill much else in terms of aesthetics, as I did not consider it a priority, however, the base was designed so that the solar panels would be held at an inclined angle, so that it can receive direct sunlight. Otherwise, if I were to further enhance the aesthetical design of my product, I would probably create an enclosed box around the breadboard and paint it so that my product would look fully furnished and complete. For my next steps, I am looking into buying a diode to prevent fluctuations or charging errors. Otherwise, my product is fully complete, and I am satisfied with what I have done. Below is the model of my structural design, as well as a picture of my completed product (again).</p>
