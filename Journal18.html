				<h2>Journal Entry #18: Giving the Charger a Full Test Run</h2>
				<h5> Can I fully charge a phone without a diode? November 18, 2018</h5>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/Kf4QbkQ.png" alt="capacitor2200" style="height:200px;">
				<p>Today I ran a full test run of my charger, charging my old phone, which was at 0% charge, and seeing if it would fully charge. Although I could not show the process, I have a start and end picture of the test charge to demonstrate the results. The charger was able to successfully charge the phone, despite it taking quite a long time. I did not record the time, but it was definitely a lengthy process. However, if my data on the charging 1% was applied to theoretically determine the charging time to fully charge a phone, it should take on average 25 hours. However, the real charging process definitely took less than 10 hours. This difference is most likely due to the fluctuation errors I discussed before. As the charger charges inconsistently, the time it takes to charge 1% may vary constantly. It would charge faster when there are less fluctuations. However, if the charge does fluctuate, it would go down before going back up, meaning it would take longer to truly charge 1%. Overall though, I have confirmed that my charger is capable of fully charging a phone and I have successfully achieved my goal.</p>

				<figcaption>Start of process - Phone has just been plugged in and is charging, currently at 0%</figcaption>

				<figcaption>End of process - Charger fully charged the phone (shows 98%, but still proves the charger is able to fully charge the phone)</figcaption>
				<p>As the results conclude that my charger successfully works, with some minor discrepancies, I can say that I have fully completed my product.</p>
