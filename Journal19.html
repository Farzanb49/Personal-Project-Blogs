				<h2>Journal Entry #19: Final Reflection</h2>
				<h5> Looking back at my process, November 20, 2018</h5>
				<img src="https://imgur.com/t4LmpyS.png" alt="capacitor2200" style="height:200px;">
				<p>As I look back on my project, I am proud of what I have accomplished. Over these past few months, I was able to successfully construct and develop my own solar powered phone charger that ran only on solar power. Additionally, the effort and time I put into the entire process, including my process journals, re-evaluating my product, and even my current in-progress work on the personal project report and presentation makes me feel quite accomplished. Throughout the project, I faced many problems when constructing my product, and had to constantly apply critical thinking skills to solve them. I gained valuable knowledge and understanding in electrical components and electronics that were very applicable in the construction of my product. This knowledge is also very applicable in the construction of electronics in general and is very useful information for fields in electronics or engineering that I may pursue. The personal project truly did develop my passion in the engineering and electrical field, and the valuable knowledge I have gained and successfully applied inspires me to pursue this field as a career. Throughout the project, I had to develop effective time management skills, and despite being slightly behind at times, I am proud of how I managed my time. I was able to successfully complete my product despite starting my project late, as I transferred to Turner Fenton just this year, and I did so while balancing school work and extracurriculars such as HOSA and basketball. I conducted thorough research throughout the project, and constantly revised and re-evaluated my process, making sure I was following my plan while successfully completing stages of my project. Overall, I am proud of what I have done and am ready to close off my project with my presentation and report.</p>
