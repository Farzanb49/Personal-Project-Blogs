				<h2>Journal Entry #6: Learning about Capacitors!</h2>
				<h5>What are capacitors used for? September 1st, 2018</h5>

				<figcaption>2200uF Capacitors for my project</figcaption>
				<p>Today I started researching and learning about capacitors. I needed to determine how crucial of a role capacitor played in my project. The capacitors were also necessary in determining various calculations related to the energy, charge, and total capacitance of my electrical device. Capacitors are a component which can store energy in the form of an electrical charge, producing a potential difference (static voltage) across its plates. Potential difference is the potential energy in a quantity of charge. And because capacitors basically store a quantity of charge, this creates a potential difference across the conductive metal plates in the capacitor. Capacitors block DC current from flowing because of the insulating material between the two conducting plates in the capacitor. However, AC current is able to freely flow through capacitors because AC currents continuously charge and discharge so its cannot be stopped by the insulating material, because it will discharge then charge back up again on the other side of the capacitor, thus letting the current continue to flow. The capacitor also helps prevent ripples in the current. They control power-supply in the device, and capacitors also help maintain and filter out unnecessary frequencies. Capacitors are found in just about any electrical devices. In my solar powered phone charger, the capacitors help prevent ripples in the current, and block out DC current. For my project, I will be using one 2200uF capacitor, and one 100uF capacitor. Farads are the unit of measurement for the capacitance in a capacitor. uF stands for microfarads, a sub-unit of Farads. Other sub-units are:
<p>-	1uF = 0.000001 Farads</p>
<p>-	1nF (nanofarads) = 0.000000001 Farads</p>
<p>-	1pF (picofarads) = 0.000000000001 Farads</p>
<p>A capacitor basically has two metal conducting plates with any kind of insulating material in between the two plates. This insulating material is known as dielectric. Below is a simple diagram of what a capacitor looks like on the inside:</p>
<img src="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap1.gif" alt="capacitor" style="height:200px;">
<p>I used some already known information to make some calculations and figure out other components of my device. The solar panel I will use has a voltage of 6V and power of 1W. My capacitors have capacitances of 100uF and 2200uF. In parallel circuits, capacitance is added together to find total capacitance. Since my electrical device uses a parallel circuit, the total capacitance of my solar powered phone charger is:</p>
<p>C1 + C2 = Ct</p> 
<p>Which is 2200uF + 100uF = 2300uF</p>
<p>To determine the energy of my circuit, I can apply the formula:</p>
<p>E = ½CV^2 = ½(0.0023)(6^2)=1/2(0.0023)(36)=0.0414J=41.4mJ</p>
<p>Where mJ is a sub-unit of Joules, which is a unit of energy (1mJ=0.001J), and C is the total capacitance in Farads (F), and V is the voltage in volts (V).</p>
<p>I also was able to calculate the charge of my device using the formula:</p> 
<p>C=Q/V</p>
<p>Or Q=CV</p>
<p>Where C is capacitance in Farads (F), Q is charge in coulombs (C), and V is voltage in volts (V)</p>
<p>The voltage of the solar panel is 6V and the total capacitance is 2300uF, which is equal to 0.0023F, so the charge is equal to:</p>
<p>Q = 0.0023(6) = 0.0138C</p>
<p>I have jotted down many more notes about capacitors, and plan to showcase more of my understanding during my final report or personal project presentation. Notes I have documented will be attached below. 
</p>
<p> This is a list of formulas I used to make some of my calculations, such as finding the charge and energy of my device:</p>

<p>This is a list of units commonly used when studying about electricity and electrical devices. The units I used to make my calculation include energy (W) in milli-joules (mJ), charge (Q) in coulombs (C), capacitance (C) in subunits of Farads (F), and voltage (V) in volts (V)</p>
