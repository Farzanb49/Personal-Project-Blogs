			<h2>Journal Entry #1: Finishing the Project Proposal, Success Criteria, and Process Plan</h2>
			<h5>Determining my topic, setting goals, and creating a plan to attain my goals, August 6, 2018</h5>

			<p>It has been a couple months since I finished my original personal project proposal, which I submitted to my mentor on July 15th, 2018. However, I went back and revised my proposal to include more potential resources as well as a more sophisticated and creative goal for me to accomplish. Everything else was the same. I brainstormed numerous ideas, and then narrowed my choices down to one idea/topic, which is to build a portable solar powered phone charger. I then discussed my motivation, which was based on my interest in technology as well as inspiration from my dad, who is an electrical engineer. Then I outlined my goals, which involved learning about electrical components and applying that knowledge into constructing a portable solar powered phone charger and then further evaluate my product and enhance it to make it more effective, and then provide a tutorial for other people to learn how to construct this kind of solar powered portable phone charger. The global contexts related to this project include scientific and technological innovation, as I am researching about electrical components, and using the knowledge to create a practical, useful, technological innovation. Finally, I mentioned any prior learning and proposed some research sources that could help me with this project.</p> 
	
			<p>Afterwards, I finished developing a success criterion, which outlined all the requirements I had to meet to achieve my goals and excel in this project. Then I created a plan and timeline that outlined what tasks I had to accomplish and when I had to accomplish them. Some deadlines may potentially be affected based on when my materials are planned to arrive. My overall criteria is to construct a portable phone charger that is purely solar powered, and have it function properly. I would then like to go back and enhance my original device to make it much more efficient and useful. While my goal includes creating a tutorial, which is what I hope to do, time constraints may make it difficult to accomplish, which is why creating a tutorial is currently not part of my success criteria, as it is not my priority, but rather an option for me to take my project a step further if I am able to. Apart from criteria related to the product itself, I hope to maintain very good time management, as well as be able to document my progress effectively and put in thorough research into my project. As for my timeline, I hope to get all my tasks accomplished no later than September 28th. My schedule may be slightly shifted based on when my products are able to arrive, as some products will ship quite late, but I should be able to manage my time effectively nevertheless.</p>
	
	<p>Therefore, as of now, I have finalized my project proposal, as well as create a success criteria and process plan to help carry out my tasks in a timely and successful manner. I am more than excited to finally start working on my project!</p>
